# CP1404 Practicals

This repository contains all the practical work for IT@JCU CP1404.

All code contained within this repository was written by Chisel (me). I'm an IT student at James Cook University & work
professionally as a Support Technician.

## Clean Code Lessons!

Here's a few lessons I've learnt over the duration of this subject in regard to writing clean code:

- Don't repeat yourself (DRY)!
- Functions should only contain code relevant to their designated task (SRP).
- Follow naming conventions!
