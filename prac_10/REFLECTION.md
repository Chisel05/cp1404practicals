# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates usually underestimate the amount of time a task will take me.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

The length of the estimate increased as I became more realistic after some experience.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

My perception of time while doing a task is extremely distorted, and that improving this would benefit me.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Different people are often gauged to recognise a particular set of mistakes over others, and by allowing others to
review your code, your personal mistake 'blind spots' are likely to be reduced.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Code reviews have emphasized the fact that, although an identical task can be assigned to multiple people, the
interpretations & results can differ, and that the best qualities of each interpretation can be combined to produce a
result inaccessible to any single interpretation.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 08 review - @Ornysha](https://github.com/Ornysha/cp1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

Suggested an achievable improvement to Ornysha's code while avoiding demanding or judgemental phrasing.

### Good Code Review 2

[N/A]()

### Explanation

I've only received one code review request.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

A time estimate for how long the entire practical should take. This helps students schedule their prac work throughout the week, while also providing a reference for how the student is performing.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Always submitting on time.
