# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've made my lecture video notes more concise, which made a meaningful difference to the number of times I look back at those notes for help.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Get the lecture videos done earlier.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

My attention to detail & willingness to research programming concepts independently if I feel like that understanding could help my overall grasp on Python.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop avoiding subject content I'm not familiar with, because It's never as difficult as I'm prone to build it up to be in my mind.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Keep the lecture videos shorter (10-25min), excluding the 'code along' or demo videos.
